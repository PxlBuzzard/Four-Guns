## What went right

* We scoped our project fairly well in that we had a working engine with multiplayer in the first couple * weeks. 
* It took a little work, but I like my sprite sheets for the players and zombies. I think they move in a * fashion that fits the sort of throwback pixelated style too. 
* The game is fairly entertaining to play with friends.
* My camera works great!

## What went wrong

* There were a few issues with organizing ourselves and communicating decisions across the entire group, * but things seemed to work out in the end.
* Merging the level editor and the game seemed to produce a good number of issues throughout the ten weeks.
* Collision still gives us some issues.
* We never really got to build a large library of guns or a way to manage them in the game.

In conclusion, I think everything turned out well. Other than the couple little bugs we have, the game runs well and it has a certain level of completeness to it. Ten weeks, however, is not nearly as much time as one might think and we all felt that to some degree. There were a lot of ideas we came up with that we knew we would never have the time to put into our game.

I think I learned a lot from making this game. This was my first experience with group projects in programming and learning to work together on code was a very different experience than working together on something like a presentation or science lab. I also discovered that I prefer having a clear chain of command when it comes to projects like this so that there is always one person who can make the final decision on an argument. We tried to just work out our issues in a democratic sort of manner, but while that worked for us, it took quite a bit of time to come to a final decision.

Like I said, I would probably form a group with a little more structure to it. I would also try to plan out what we were going to do a little more as well. I generally like to organize rather than jump right into coding and with this group we pretty much jumped right in.
