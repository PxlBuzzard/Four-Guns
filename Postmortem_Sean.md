I had so much fun working in this group. I think that our game turned out really nicely, and I think that it is really fun. I definitely would work on this game again, and I probably will while I’m at RIT.

## What went right

#### Four player deathmatch

We originally didn’t think that we were going to do much with competitive multiplayer, but as we were testing the game, we started testing deathmatch and found that it was really fun. We then worked on making the deathmatch as playable and fun as we could, and I think that we did a good job with that.

#### The scope

I think that this was a well scoped game. While our initial pitch was definitely overscoped, after we presented we quickly realized that we wouldn’t be able to manage creating everything that we wanted, and we quickly scoped it down. The result is a polished multiplayer game that is fun to play. 

## What went wrong

#### Communication

In the beginning of the project Daniel and myself quickly developed a rough engine, that did most of what we wanted, however we did not communicate as well as we could have, and as a result some group members didn’t understand all of the code at first. We did fix this by sitting down and explaining all of what was going on in the code, and adding a significant amount of comments to the code, explaining what everything did.

## Scheduling

We definitely could have scheduled our time better. We got all the work done in the end, but oftentimes we would have conflicting schedules outside of class, which meant it was hard to meet as a whole group outside of class. It wasn’t easy to schedule times because of all of our different schedules, but I think that we should have made more of an effort to meet as a whole group outside of class. That being said, we were given enough time during class to meet that we managed to get all of the work done that we needed.

## Conclusions
Through this project I learned a lot more about game design in teams. I had never worked in a team on a big project like this, and it was definitely a rewarding experience to work as a team. I learned that making schedules work together is a difficult task, but in a team it is necessary to get everyone working together. I also learned that in a game project communication is key. Not only is an increased amount of comments necessary, but also team meetings are key because it is in those meetings that changes and additions are discussed and explained to the whole team. If I could have done this project again I would not have changed much, but I would have had us meet more often. Other than that I would definitely have had the same team, as we worked really well together, and we made a game that I am proud of. We plan on continuing our game at some point so I am really excited for that, whether that is over the summer or next year, we don’t know yet, but regardless I will enjoy expanding on FourGuns. This project was one of the best experiences that I had this year, and I hope to work with the same group members over the course of my time at RIT.
