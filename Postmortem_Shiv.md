## What went right?

As a group the things that went right were that the ideas that we had from the beginning got implemented into our game. This was because we had scoped the game pretty well from the beginning so most of what was taken out were ideas that we had later on during development. 
What went right from my part of development with the external tool was that after it was completed it made creating levels very easy and it was user friendly as well with a slight learning curve. I was happy about this because it would make creating levels much easier if we decided to continue and expand the game. 

## What went wrong?

Things that went wrong were things such as meeting conflicts, and communication at times. During the first few weeks we tried to meet at least once maybe twice a week as a group to discuss what we were all doing and what needed to be done. This was not the case after a couple weeks after, we started to have barely any meetings, most of them were held during class when we had work days. This was not a bad idea but our group could have met more which would have led to better communication which was another problem. There were times in which people would not be communicating enough with the rest of the group. Although this was solved in the end it could have been prevented. Other than that development went pretty well.

## Conclusions

We started developing ideas for the game very early on and worked on trying to get the scope of our game to a point at which we were certain we could work with. There were things which got cut out but they did not affect the fun aspect of the game. 
From this project I basically learned the process that goes into developing a game from scratch. Also how to work under pressure of a deadline and how to work with others and divide roles so that things get finished on time.
If I were to do this project again I would make sure that the team met more during development so that there would not be any communication problems. Also I would also try to have everyone work in the labs together more often so that if something went wrong and someone needed help the others would be there to help instead of them waiting till the next class.
